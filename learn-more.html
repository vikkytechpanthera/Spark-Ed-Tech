                About the Youth Empowerment Program
            </div>
            <div class="dash-2"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">The unemployment rate in Nigeria is alarming, prompting many youths to seek tech skills to better position themselves in the labor market. However, a significant number are hindered by a lack of resources to pursue this endeavor.  

                The Youth Tech Empowerment Program aims to equip such individuals with essential resources, including personal computers (PCs), internet connectivity, and mentorship opportunities, enabling them to seamlessly acquire their desired skills. The ultimate goal is to empower participants for employment while fostering a culture of giving back through a "Pay it Forward" model.

                         <p>   * Participants must actively engage in the learning process and strive to acquire the tech skills outlined in their application.  
                         <p>   * Participants will use the provided resources (PC, internet connectivity, mentorship) exclusively for learning and skill development.  
                         <p>  * Participants must dedicate the necessary time and effort to complete their chosen training program within the specified duration (e.g., 3-6 months, 6-12 months, etc.).  
                         <p>  * Participants will provide regular updates on their learning progress, which may include monthly reports, participation in check-in meetings, and submission of certifications or evidence of course completion.  
                         <p>  * Participants must comply with all guidelines and policies set by the organisation, including responsible use of resources and active participation in mentorship sessions.  
                         <p>  * Upon completing the program and securing a job, participants agree to "Pay it Forward" by supporting other youths. This could include donating a personal computer to the organisation for a new participant, providing mentorship, sharing resources, or offering other forms of support.
